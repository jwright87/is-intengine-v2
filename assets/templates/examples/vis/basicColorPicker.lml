<!-- As opposed to ColorPicker, BasicColorPicker is not
    a dialog - it's a regular widget that you can insert
    into your custom UI. It does have to create a texture,
    so it needs to be disposed, but since VisUI 0.9.3,
    color pickers are reasonably light ("light enough")
    to use customized instances in multiple screens,
    rather than cache and reuse a single dialog. -->
    
<basicPicker listener=changeColor oneColumn=true
        onCreate=scheduleDispose><:row/>
    Pickers extend VisTable, so they can handle
    any tags and contain all Table attributes.
    Use the picker to change this icon's color:
	<image id=change style=icon-trash size=66 />
</basicPicker>

<!-- ExtendedColorPicker (extendedPicker tag) also
    contains HSV, RGB and (optionally) alpha bar.
    Except for the additional widgets, it works
    pretty much the same and has no extra attributes. -->
