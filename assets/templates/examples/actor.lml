<!-- Constructs an Actor instance,
    which does not render itself: -->
<actor/>

<!-- They can be used as mock-up
    elements of tables, for example. -->

<!-- Parental actor tag creates a Group -
    simple container for multiple actors: -->
<actor>
    <textButton>Children appended to group</textButton>
    Plain text parsed as labels.
</actor>

<!-- These are not advised to be used though,
    as their subclasses are much more flexible.
    As you probably noticed, parsed template looks...
    Yeah, not too well. -->
