<!-- Check boxes extend text buttons with
    (un)checked icon, but actually its toggle
    functionality is present in a regular button.
    Basically, wigdet just gets a style upgrade
    and another child: Image. -->
<checkBox onChange=switchCase>click me!</checkBox>

<!-- Check boxes convert text between tags into
    their label, but since they are tables, they
    can append any other children. -->
<checkBox text="Original. ">
    <label row=true>Additional label.</label>
    <label colspan=3>Another row of labels.</label>
</checkBox>

<!-- Since check boxes consist of a label and an
    image, they can also have their attributes. -->
