<!-- Buttons are basic Table extensions
    with default click listeners and
    (un)checked status. -->
<button/>

<!-- Since they are Tables, they can parse
    any actors and append them to their cells.
    Button's size will change to show all its
    children actors. -->
<button><actor size=128/></button>

<!-- They can be used to simulate text
    buttons, although labels will not
    change style according to button state,
    because they are separate widgets,
    rather than internal parts of button. -->
<button style=toggle checked=true>Text as label</button>
<!-- The above example would work the same
    way if the text was in <label></label> tags. -->
