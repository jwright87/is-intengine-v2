<!-- Regular for-each macro can be used to iterate
    over multiple LML arrays at once. To nest multiple
    iterations, you can literally nest for-each macros.
    But sometimes you need a common iteration index -
    the easiest way to achieve this is using a nested
    for-each macro. -->

<:eachNested color=white;vis-blue
        value=First;Second;Third range=[-1,-3]>
    <label color={color}>
        {eachNested:index}: {value}{range}
    </label>
</:eachNested>

<!-- Iteration index is available through
    {tagName:index} argument, where "tagName"
    is the alias of macro tag you used. -->
