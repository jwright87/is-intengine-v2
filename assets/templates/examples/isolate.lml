<!-- There are times where you want to create
    actors using LML, but do not immediately add
    them to stage or any other actors. A good
    example might be a dialog - they are generally
    shown as informations or warnings after a user
    performs a specific action. This is possible to
    do with the "isolate" tag. It internally uses
    an ActorStorage widget, which maintains an array
    of actors, but does not draw them. It immediately
    removes itself from stage when you add it by
    mistake. Also, it never adds itself to its parent,
    so you basically can put this tag anywhere. -->

<isolate>
    A label will be created, but not added to stage.
    <button>This won't be on stage as well.</button>
</isolate>

<label>Outside of isolation.</label>

<!-- You can access the isolated actors by their ID
    or getters in the ActorStorage widget. -->

<actorStorage>
    <dialog id="someDialog">
        Accessible through "someDialog" ID.
    </dialog>
</actorStorage>
