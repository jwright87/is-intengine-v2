<!-- AnimatedImage is a new LML actor. Based on
    regular Image, this widget allows to display
    multiple animated frames in a specified order.
    It expects an array of drawable IDs in its
    style attribute. See arrays example for more
    info about the syntax. -->

<animatedImage style="icon-trash;icon-drive;icon-folder"/>

<!-- "frames" attribute also works, but its not
    a mere alias of "style". Style attribute is
    parsed _before_ the widget is created - frames
    attribute is parsed _after_, so it can properly
    invoke actions. It appends new frames, rather
    than replacing the old ones. -->
