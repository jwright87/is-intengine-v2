<!-- Actor macro expects at least one argument: method name
    that returns an instance of an actor. The second argument
    will be set as actor's ID and is optional. Actor is
    properly handled by the current parental tag. -->

<:actor getSomeActor customId/>

    In a table:
    <!-- You can also use named parameters: -->
    <:actor method="getSomeActor" id="otherId" />
</table>

<!-- This macro allows you to add your customized actors
    to LML templates without defining new tags. However,
    such actors cannot have any attributes, so you have to
    fully customize them in Java - that's why custom tags
    are often preferred. -->
