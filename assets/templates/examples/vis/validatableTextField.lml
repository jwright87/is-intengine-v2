<!-- You can create a text field that validates its input
    with LML. Attaching validators is pretty straightforward:
    you just have to add a validator child to a text field/
    Only VisValidatableTextFields can handle validators, so
    make sure you use correct text field tag before adding
    a validator. -->

<table oneColumn=true>
    Int:
    <validatable>
        15
        <integerValidator/>
    </validatable>
    Float:
    <validatable>
        15.0
        <floatValidator/>
    </validatable>
    Greater than 8:
    <validatable>
        15
        <greaterThan value=8 />
    </validatable>
    Lesser than or equal to 12:
    <validatable>
        15
        <lesserThan value=12 orEqual=true />
    </validatable>

<!-- Multiple validators are supported. -->
    Between 0 (including) and 1 (excluding):
    <validatableTextField text="0.15">
        <isFloat/>
        <greaterThan value=0 orEqual=true />
        <lesserThan value=1 orEqual=false />
    </validatableTextField>

<!-- You can attach a custom validator by suppling a name of
    a method that consumes a string and returns a boolean: -->
    Custom - is not blank:
    <validatable>
        Delete me.
        <validator validate=isNotBlank />
    </validatable>
</table>

<!-- This would fail, as regular text fields cannot have
    validators. You can try uncommenting code below. -->
