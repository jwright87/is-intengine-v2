<!-- Custom macros can be registered directly in Java.
    A new tag (both actor and macro), has to implement
    LmlTag interface - but doing as at its whole is
    pretty complex. Fortunately, you can use abstract
    class: AbstractMacroLmlTag, which basically forces
    you to override only 1 method and focus on macro
    functionality. In Main class, we registered a macro
    that changes its data between tags to upper case. -->

<label color="vis-red">
    <:uppercase>
        no more shouting!
    </:uppercase>
</label>
