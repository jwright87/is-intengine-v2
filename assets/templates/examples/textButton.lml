<!-- Text buttons are buttons extended with an
    internal label. Additionally to button attributes,
    they can also have attributes of labels that
    will affect their text. -->

<textButton>Hello.</textButton>

<!-- Since buttons extend table, they can have any
    children. On contrary to tables and regular
    buttons, textButtons will append plain text
    between their tags to their internal label. -->

<textButton text="Initial." multiline=true>
    This will be also
    appended to button text.
    No new labels are created.
    <actor row=true/>
    <label color="vis-blue">
        This is a separate label.
    </label>
</textButton>
