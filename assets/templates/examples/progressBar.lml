<!-- Progress bars can be easily used
    as loading bars and game logic UI
    elements (for example: health amount). -->

<label>Click bars to load.</label>

<progressBar onClick=load vertical=true />

<!-- Progress bars cannot have children, but they
    can process plain text - as long as it is a valid
    float, it will be set as bar's current progress.
    Note that it is _not_ a simple "value" attribute
    alias: "value" is parser _before_ the actor is
    created, so it will not trigger any change listeners.
    Value between tags, on the other hand, is parsed
    _after_ actor is created (and has processed all its
    tags), so it can trigger registered listeners. -->
