<!-- Sliders are progress bars updated
    with touch input listener. Since their
    value can be manipulated, they can be
    used for various numeric settings. -->

<slider />
<slider value=25 min=0 max=200 stepSize=5
    animateDuration=0.5 />
<slider vertical=true />

<!-- Sliders cannot have tag children, altough they
    can process plain text - as long as it is a valid
    float, it will be set as slider's current value.
    Note that it is _not_ a simple "value" attribute
    alias: "value" is parser _before_ the actor is
    created, so it will not trigger any change listeners.
    Value between tags, on the other hand, is parsed
    _after_ actor is created (and has processed all its
    tags), so it can trigger registered listeners. -->
