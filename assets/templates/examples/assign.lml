<!-- Assignment macro allows you to assign arguments
    from within LML templates. Since it allows to easily
    assign LML snippets, it is the offen preferred way to
    define arguments as opposed to adding them in Java. -->

<!-- First macro attribute is the name of the argument to assign.
    The rest will be merged and assigned to the argument. -->

<:assign myArgument This will become argument value./>
<label>{myArgument}</label>

<:assign key="newArgument" value="Named attributes also work."/>
<label>{newArgument}</label>

<!-- If the macro is parental and contains data between
    tags, the data will become argument value rather
    than leftover macro attributes. This is very useful
    for assigning LML snippets to arguments. -->

<:assign key="myLabel">
    <label color="vis-blue">Tag in LML argument.</label>
</:assign>
{myLabel}
