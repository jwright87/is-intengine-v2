<!-- There are times when you want to display certain
    actors after a delay - for example, when a button
    is clicked. You don't have to attach standard
    listeners with "onClick" attribute and create the
    actors manually: you can do that within LML
    templates using "clickListener" tag. -->

<button>Click me!
	<clickListener>
	    <dialog style="dialog">Thanks for clicking!
	        <textButton onResult="close">Now close me.</textButton>
	    </dialog>
	</clickListener>
</button>

<!-- The dialog within clickListener tag will be created
    once (during template parsing) and displayed each time
    you click the button. If you need to, you can also add
    an condition which has to be met in order to show the
    dialog: -->

<button>50% chance for a surprise!
	<onClick if="$random < 0.5">
	    <dialog style="dialog" title="You're lucky!">Thanks for clicking!
	        <textButton onResult="close">Now close me.</textButton>
	    </dialog>
	</onClick>
</button>

<!-- Before this dialog is shown, method mapped to "random"
    is invoked. It returns a random number in range of [0, 1).
    If the number is lower than 0.5, dialog is shown.
    Needless to say, the dialog should be displayed roughly
    half of the times you click the button. -->

<!-- Sometimes you might want to attach the same listener to
    multiple actors. You may even want to create some complex
    actors and share them across views. Thanks to "ids" and
    "keep" arguments, you can. The listener will be attached
    to all actors with the selected IDs. If "keep" is set to
    true, the listener will not be removed after template
    parsing and will be available in all views. Try adding
    'keep="true"' attribute, parse the template, then remove
    the whole listener and parse it again - you'll see that
    listener will still get attached to button with "another"
    ID:  -->

<textButton>I have the same listener!
    <onClick ids="another">
        <dialog style="dialog" title="$random">
             Attached to multiple actors.
	        <textButton onResult="close">Great.</textButton>
        </dialog>
    </onClick>
</textButton>
<textButton id="another">Me too!</textButton>

<!-- Note that listeners need to be inside an actor tag. -->
