<!-- Toasts are customizable messages displayed over
    the stage. They are usually used as informations
    or warnings for the user. Toasts not are usually
    immediately displayed and usually require some
    previous action from the user. Toast must be shown
    using ToastManager API to ensure proper behavior.
    That's why - rather than using them as root tags -
    toasts should be parsed along with other widgets,
    but put in isolation tag and added later, in Java. -->

<isolate>
    <toast onClose="addToast">Some important message.</toast>
</isolate>

<!-- See MainView#addToast() method to see how toasts
    are appended to the stage. -->

<label>Only this label will be added immediately.</label>
<isolate>
    <toast id="myToast" onClose="addToast" oneColumn="true"
            background="window-bg">
        <textButton>Can have any children.</textButton>
        <label pad="8">And any table tags.</label>
    </toast>
</isolate>

<!-- Note that if you click on this window, toasts will
    go underneath - this is expected, as windows always
    put themselves on the front when interacted with. -->
