<!-- You can register your own attributes directly in Java.
    All you have to do is implement LmlAttribute interface
    (which is rather trivial) and supply aliases of the
    attribute. It will be available for the actor class tree
    of chosen base class. In Main class, we registered an
    attribute that supports Actor.class, so it is available
    for all tags. -->
