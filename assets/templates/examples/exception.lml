<!-- You can force the parser to throw an exception
    from within LML templates without any ugly hacks.
    Meaningful exception reasons can be passed with
    text between macro tags. -->

<:if 24 < 12>
    <label>This is correct... or is it?</label>
<:if:else/>
    <:exception>I'm not very good at maths.</:exception>
</:if>

<!-- This macro takes one optional boolean attribute.
    If it is true, exception will be thrown regardless
    of parser settings (default behavior). If false is
    passed, it will throw exception only if the parser
    is strict. -->

<:throwException false>
    This is thrown when parser is strict.
</:throwException>

<!-- Named attributes are also supported. -->
<:error strict="true" message="Example exception." />
