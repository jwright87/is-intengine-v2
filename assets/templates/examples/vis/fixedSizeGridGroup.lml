<!-- FixedSizeGridGroup is a specialized GridGroup,
    that keeps its children count constant thanks to
    mock-up actors in "empty" cells. It also comes
    with a custom Draggable, which allows to swap its
    children, rather than just move them around. In
    LML, it is available through dragPane tag - use
    type=fixed attribute to switch to this group. -->

<!-- Note that all icons are draggable and swapable.
    With a more appropriate, customized background,
    this would look and feel very much alike a RPG-
    style inventory. -->
